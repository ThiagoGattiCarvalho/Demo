ABOUT THIS DEMO

After years working as a Supply Chain consultant implementing industry leading software and creating Excel solutions for Finance and S&OP, I have decided to integrate my knowledge and experience into a single Python application. 

IBP - Integrated Business Planning is the app's focus, because it synchronizes Finance and Supply Chain algorithms into a single set of numbers. This way, planning is faster and easier, which is my objective, rather than just building a "software".

With this demo, I expect to briefly demonstrate my digital competence.
